  Let $P_{ab}(t)$ be the probability of finding the particle in the range $(a<x<b)$, at time $t$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Show that $$\dfrac{dP_{ab}}{dt}=J(a,t)-J(b,t)$$ \\
    , where \\
    $$J(x,t)\equiv \dfrac{i \hbar}{2m} \left(\Psi \dfrac{\partial \Psi^*}{\partial x}-\Psi^* \dfrac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\right)$$
    What are the units of $J(x,t)?$ Comment: $J$ is called the \textbf{probability current}, because it tells you the rate at which 
    probability is "flowing" past the point $x$. If $P_{ab}(t)$ is increasing, then more probability is flowing into the region
    at one end than flows out at the other.
    
    \item Find the probability current for the wave function in Problem 1.9. (This is not a very pithy example, I am afraid
    ; we will encounter more substantial ones in due course.)
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{2.18}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Find the probability current, J (Problem 1.14) for the free particlen wave function Equation 2.95. which
    direction does the probability flow?
  \end{itemize}

  A free particle has the initial wave function \\
  $$\Psi(x,0)=Ae^{-a|x|}$$
  where $A$ and $a$ are positive real constants.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Normalize $\Psi(x,0)$.

    \item Find $\phi(k)$.

    \item Construct $\Psi(x,t)$, in the form of an integral.

    \item Discuss the limiting cases (a very large, and a very small).
  \end{itemize}

  In this problem you will show that the number of nodes of the stationary states of a one-dimensional potential always 
  increases with energy. Consider two (real, normalized) solutions ($\psi_n$ and $\psi_m$) to the time-independent 
  Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation (for a given potential $V(x)$), with energies $E_n > E_m$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Show that \\
    $$\dfrac{d}{dx} \left(\dfrac{d \psi_m}{dx}\psi_n-\psi_m\dfrac{d \psi_n}{dx}\right)=\dfrac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_n-E_m) \psi_m \psi_n$$

    \item Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two adjacent nodes of the function $\psi_m(x)$.Show that \\
    $$\psi^'_m(x_2) \psi_n(x_2)-\psi^'_m(x_1) \psi_n(x_1)=\dfrac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E_n-E_m) \bigints_{x_1}^{x_2} \psi_m \psi_n dx$$

    \item If $\psi_n(x)$ has no nodes between $x_1$ and $x_2$, then it must have the same sign everywhere 
    in the interval. Show that (b) then leads to a contradiction. Therefore, between every pair of nodes of
    $\psi_m(x), ~ \psi_n(x)$ must have at \emph{least} one node, and in particular the number of nodes 
    increases with energy.
  \end{itemize}

  Imagine a bead of mass $m$ that slides frictionlessly around a circular wire ring of circumference $L$. 
  (This is just like a free particle, except that $\psi(x+L)=\psi(x)$) Find trhe stationary states (with
  appropriate normalization) and the corresponding allowed energies. Note that there are (with one exception)
  \emph{two} independent solutions for each energy $E_n$ corresponding to clockwise and counterf-clockwise
  circulation; call them $\psi^+_n(x)$ and $\psi^-_n(x)$. How do you account for this degeneracy, in
  view of the theorem in Problem 2.44 (why does the theorem fail, in this case)?
